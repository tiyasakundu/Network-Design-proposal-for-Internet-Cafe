# Network-Design-proposal-for-Internet-Cafe
A network design proposal needs to be prepared for an Internet 
cafe. The following are the requirements. The cafe is to support 30 
users and requires a web filtering device or software to filter 
websites based on content. 
The users need to share one ADSL internet connection. The cafe 
has to be managed with a billing software. 
A network for the same was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer 
version 8.0.0. The requirements were emulated and tested for 
connectivity. A server was setup, which is accessible only on port 
443 with HTTPS connectivity. Internally, department routers are 
interconnected for unfiltered access to the server. 
The cafe router has NAT to translate public IP address to private 
device IP addresses. Switches are used to ensure optimal number 
of devices can be used with both the cafe network as well as the 
broadband network.
Pings were used to check the connectivity and the reachability of 
the systems from all the network.
